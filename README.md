# RPI_GroupRide

This repository contains/will contain the iOS and Android implementations of RPI GroUber, an application meant to make cheap transportation more accessible to RPI students.

The application acts as a social network. Students can make posts about an Uber/Lyft ride they intend to take (and at what time), notifying RPI students in their area. These notified students then have the option to join the Uber/Lyft group (a.k.a the GroupRide) and communicate with the individuals in the group.
