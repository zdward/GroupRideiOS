# RPI_GroUber

This repository contains/will contain the iOS and Android implementations of RPI GroUber, an application meant to make cheap transportation more accessible to RPI students.

The application acts as a social network. Students can make posts about an Uber ride they intend to take (and at what time), notifying RPI students in their area. These notified students then have the option to join the Uber group (a.k.a the GroUber) and communicate with the individuals in the group.
